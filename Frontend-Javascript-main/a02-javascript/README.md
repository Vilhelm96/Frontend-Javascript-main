# A02 JavaScript

The assignment a02 is two parts, first part is making a hangman game using javascript, html and css. We have a array of words, when we start the hangman game we take one of the words and the users try to guess what word that has been generated. If the letter is wrong a part of the hangman picture gets output, if user guesses wrong to many time they loose and the game starts over.

Second Part we use snowpack, javascript, css and html to create a localhost of the quiz application. We use Get and Post to get the questions and url to send to from the json that has been created by the teacher. Then we take the questions and output in the browser. We then answer the question and send the answer using Post to a url to see if the answer is correct. If it is we get a new question and new url to send to. This repeats until the quiz is finished.
