                        I use the OS Windows 10 and for this report I used Git bash through terminal,
                        but this might change to GUI later on. I will use Visual studio code, but might
                        also change this to IntelliJ ultimate later on depending if I like this texteditor or not.
                        I like to use Sonarlint as well, since it can help me better my code and find issues I might
                        otherwise miss.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        I have used Git bash before, but usually it has ended up with using some kind of tool
                        such as Github desktop or just use the tools available in IntelliJ where you can connect to
                        Github and push and pull there. I want to learn to use Git bash, but I'm not entirely sure why
                        it's prefered over more simple apps such as github desktop and the tools in IntelliJ.
                        I usually try to save all my code in either Github or Gitlab since it is pretty handy to be able
                        to access your code from whatever computer you are using at the time or if your computer somehow
                        stops working so that you don't loose your code forever.

                    <li>
                        I have created websites in projects with other classmates through school courses, but
                        I feel like I still have a lot to learn. Outside of that I've not to much experience.
                        So this course is very welcome and I look forward to learn more in depth about web developement.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        I have had a course where I learned html and css on a beginner level and then I have had
                        two projects where we used typescript and angular. Due to not having a good introduction for
                        typescript and the course did not have any good tools I feel like I still have a lot to learn
                        about
                        web developement. I want to learn more about, javascript/typescript and framework such as
                        angular.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        TIL that there is something called ssh keys which you can generate through Git bash and this can
                        be used to connect to Gitlab. I learned some new commands on Git bash through the work with git
                        that is
                        provided on the coursepage which is greatly appreciated. I also learned some more about the
                        preprocessors
                        in css such as sass, less and stylus, I felt like they had farily similar features, but I have
                        so far
                        only read about each of them briefly so I might have missed something that makes them all
                        unique.
                        I learned about the arrow functions that can be used to reduce code lines.

                <p>My name is Vilhelm Park, I was born and grew up in Gislaved a small town in Småland,
                    I liked to play football growing up, I played a big variety of sports growing up
                    such as football, bandy, ice hockey, track and field and for some time I also practiced Judo.
                    I attended the regular gymnasium in Gislaved. I've been working in factory, previous to starting
                    my studies in Växjö.
